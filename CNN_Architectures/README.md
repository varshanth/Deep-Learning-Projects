# 1. CNN Architectures

Implementation in Keras 

## 1. Aggregated Residual Networks
- Implemented as POC for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets i.e. not tuned to provide max accuracy  
- Based on:  
Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks by Xie et al.  
https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431

## 2. Dense Networks  
- Implemented as POC for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets i.e. not tuned to provide max accuracy  
- Based on:  
Densely Connected Convolutional Networks by Huang et al.  
https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993  

## 3. Spore Network
## 4. Cherry Network  
  
Based on:
SporeNet and CherryNet: Fusion Variants of Aggregated Residual Networks and Densely Connected Networks  
  
Will be uploaded once the results of the paper submission are released
